## Initial setup

The best way to edit/create the site content on a local PC is to use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), an open-source code editor from Microsoft. It has validation capabilities for YAML data files using JSON schema, and the project contains relevant schema files and the .vscode folder with corresponding project settings.

List of optional VS Code extensions for a comfortable work:

1. [YAML Support by Red Hat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml) - to validate YAML data files
2. [Markdown All in One](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one) - for comfort content editing
3. [markdownlint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint) - to check content file syntax
