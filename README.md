# classicaplus-hugo

[Hugo](https://gohugo.io) source of [classicaplus.com](http://classicaplus.com) website.

This project is in Work in progress status, the current production site is created using another static site generator.


## Initial setup

The best way to edit/create the site content on a local PC is to use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), an open-source code editor from Microsoft. It has validation capabilities for YAML data files using JSON schema, and the project contains relevant schema files and the .vscode folder with corresponding project settings.

List of VS Code extensions to be installed for a comfortable work:
1. [YAML Support by Red Hat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml) - to validate YAML data files
2. [markdownlint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint) - to check content file syntax
